description: Compose a gauntlet-loop prompt — fan out subagents, pair each with a blind critic, loop until a stated bar is met. Use when the user says "/gauntlet-loop", "gauntlet", "fai un gauntlet loop", or asks to push an existing build to a much higher quality bar by brute force. NOT for a first draft, NOT for a small fix.

# Gauntlet loop

A prompt structure (Matt Schumer, Aug 2026) for spending a lot of model time to
push quality past what a single pass reaches. Three parts, in this order:

1. **Task** — what to build or improve.
2. **Build method** — break the goal into the smallest independent pieces; fan
   out one worker subagent per piece; pair each worker with a **separate**
   critic subagent that did not write the code.
3. **Bar** — the stopping condition. The loop runs until every critic passes
   its piece against the bar.

The critic being separate is the whole trick: a model that just wrote something
grades its own work generously. Anthropic's *Building effective agents* (2024)
calls this the evaluator-optimizer pattern; the gauntlet loop just runs it wide
and long.

## When NOT to use it

**Never as the first prompt on a new build.** The loop optimises hard toward
whatever direction the agent happened to pick, so a wrong direction gets
polished to a mirror finish. In the source demo this produced a genuinely
beautiful landing page that matched nothing about the client's brand system.

Start from something already on brief — an approved design direction (see the
`rivet` skill for finding one), an MVP, a design system — and use the gauntlet
loop as the second pass that sharpens it. Also skip it for anything small: it
costs hours and a lot of tokens by construction.

## Writing the bar (the part that decides if this works)

The original phrasing is *"do not stop until each critic is utterly wowed
compared to \<named reference\>"*. A subjective bar like that never converges —
in the source demo it ran two hours and the critics were still unsatisfied,
because "wowed" has no false. Name a concrete reference rather than an
adjective ("compared to Call of Duty", not "make it AAA"), and prefer a bar
something can *fail*:

- **A command that exits non-zero.** Best case. `npm run check`, a test suite,
  a lint gate, a project's own harness. The critic runs it and reads the output.
- **A measured comparison.** Playwright `toHaveScreenshot` against a baseline,
  a DOM audit (`scripts/ui-audit.js`), axe-core for a11y. Numbers, not opinions.
- **A named artefact to match.** A reference photo, a competitor page, a
  screenshot. The critic puts render and reference side by side and lists
  specific mismatches.
- **Subjective, last resort.** If nothing above applies, cap the rounds
  explicitly ("at most 3 rounds") so the loop terminates on the counter.

Never let a VLM adjudicate fine geometry or pixel-level layout — it is a
gut-check ("does this look like a horse at all"), not a measuring tool. Where a
numeric harness exists, the VLM's verdict never overrides it.

Keep any existing green gate as a **regression net** in the bar: "all current
checks stay green" plus "the new goal is met". Otherwise the loop happily
trades away what already worked.

## How the loop is allowed to end

A loop that cannot say *why* it stopped will eventually report a budget as a
result. Three rules keep the ending honest — the workflow enforces them, and a
prose run should follow them too:

- **The gate decides, the counters don't.** Running out of rounds, tokens, or
  time is a reason the loop stopped; it is never evidence the bar was met.
  Report those runs as red or unverified and say which pieces are still open.
- **Never rerun an unchanged failed gate.** If a round leaves the tree exactly
  as it was and the critic lists the same defects, the worker cannot move that
  piece: spending another worker and critic buys the same answer. Stop the piece
  and report it as stalled. (Prime Agent's autonomous mode makes the same call —
  it advances the attempt count instead of rerunning.)
- **A missing verdict is not a pass.** A critic that died, was skipped, or ran
  out of budget verified nothing. That piece is *unverified*, which is worse
  than red: red was measured, unverified was not.

## Composing the prompt

Fill this in and hand it back to the user (or run it, if they asked you to):

```
TASK
<what to build or improve, with the starting point named — repo path, current
 build, approved direction>

BUILD METHOD
Break this into the smallest independent pieces. Fan out one subagent per
piece. Pair each with a separate critic subagent that did not do the work; the
critic verifies against the bar below and sends the piece back with specific
defects if it fails.

BAR
<the falsifiable condition — command, measurement, or named reference>
<the regression net — what must stay green>
<round cap, if the bar is subjective>
```

## Prefer the workflow when the bar is a command

A prompt asks the orchestrating agent to behave; a workflow script *guarantees*
the shape. When the bar is something runnable, use `Workflow` with
`~/.claude/workflows/gauntlet.js` instead — deterministic fan-out, critics that
actually execute the check, and a loop that stops on the exit code rather than
on a mood. Pass `args`: `{ task, projectPath, pieces[], checkCommand, bar,
references[], maxRounds, serial, pieceCount, roundCost }`.

It returns an explicit `outcome` — `green`, `red`, or `unverified` — plus
`failed[]` (each with `stalled`), `unverified[]` (each with `reason: budget |
critic-missing`), and the final regression verdict. Report that field as-is:
only `green` means the bar was met. Its own tests live next to it, run them
after any edit:

```bash
node ~/.claude/workflows/gauntlet.test.mjs
```

Reach for the prose prompt when the work is exploratory enough that you cannot
name the pieces up front.
